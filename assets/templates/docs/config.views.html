<h1>Views</h1>
<p>Server-sent views are a classic and effective way to get your app up and running.
Views are normally served from controllers, but by default, Sails also exposes routes to allow you to preview your viewsn in a browser.  This automatic routing can be disabled using the <code>blueprint</code> config below.  You can also configure your templating language/framework of choice, and configure Sails&rsquo; layout support.</p>
<h2>Routes</h2>
<p>If enabled, views are automatically served at logical routes, based on their paths. This comes in handy any time you just want to serve some static HTML. (i.e. a brochure site)</p>
<p>For example, the static view files below are available at the specified routes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>views/catalog.ejs</code>          : <code>get /catalog</code></li>
<li><code>views/catalog/index.ejs</code>    : both <code>get /catalog</code> &amp; <code>get /catalog/index</code></li>
<li><code>views/catalog/story.ejs</code>    : <code>get /catalog/story</code></li>
</ul>
<h2>Layouts</h2>
<p>Layouts are simply top-level HTML templates you can use as wrappers for your server-side views.  If you&rsquo;re using ejs, you can take advantage of Sails&rsquo; built-in <code>layout</code> support.</p>
<p>With using a layout, when one of your views is served, it is injected into the <code>&lt;%- body %&gt;</code> partial defined in the layout.  This lets you reuse header and footer logic between views.</p>
<p>The <code>layout</code> setting may be set to one of:</p>
<ul>
<li>true            ::    use default (&lsquo;layout&rsquo;), located at <code>views/layout.ejs</code></li>
<li>false        ::    don&rsquo;t use a layout</li>
<li>&ldquo;string&rdquo;        ::    the relative path to your layout from <code>views/</code></li>
<li>the view engine extension, e.g. &ldquo;.ejs&rdquo;, may be omitted)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&rsquo;d like to use more than one <code>layout</code> file, you can! Before rendering a view, override the <code>layout</code> locally by setting <code>res.locals.layout</code>. (handy if you parts of your app are completely different from each other.)</p>
<p>e.g. your default might be <code>layout: &#39;layouts/public&#39;</code>, But you might override that in some of your controllers with:
<code>layout: &#39;layouts/internal&#39;</code></p>
<h2>Engine</h2>
<h3>Templating engine/language to be used for your app&rsquo;s <strong>server-side</strong> views</h3>
<p>Currently supported:
+ ejs
+ jade</p>
<h3>Using Layouts With Other View Engines</h3>
<p>In Express 3, built-in support for layouts/partials was deprecated. Instead, developers are expected to rely on the view engines themselves to implement this features. (See <a href="https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/issues/494">https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/issues/494</a> for more info on that.)</p>
<p>Since adopting Express 3, Sails has chosen to support the legacy <code>layouts</code> feature for convenience, backwards compatibility with Express 2.x and Sails 0.8.x apps, and in particular, familiarity for new community members coming from other MVC frameworks. As a result, layouts have only been tested with the default view engine (ejs).</p>
<p>If layouts aren&rsquo;t your thing, or (for now) if you&rsquo;re using a server-side view engine other than ejs, (e.g. Jade, handlebars, haml, dust) you&rsquo;ll need to set this option to: <code>layout:false</code> and then rely on your view engine&rsquo;s built-in layout/partial support.</p>
