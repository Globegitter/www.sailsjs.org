<h1>Assets</h1>

<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> You are viewing the Sails.js v0.9.0 documentation.  If you&#39;re looking for information on v0.8.x, please visit <a href="http://08x.sailsjs.org">here</a>.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Assets refer to anything (js, css, html, images, etc) that needs to be accessible to the outside world. 
The <code>assets</code> folder is where all of your assets will go, and will be served as static assets. 
If you have experience with <a href="http://www.expressjs.com">Express</a>, it is equivalent to the <code>public</code> folder (the same as in Sails 0.8.x).  </p>
<p>However, Sails does do a few extra things to help you out:
 - Automatic LESS compilation
 - Automatic JST compilation
 - Optional automatic asset injection, minification, and concatenation</p>
<p>In order to take advantage of asset injection, minification, and concatenation you must put your assets in folder under 
<code>assets/linker</code>. Any asset you put in <code>linker</code> will be automatically injected based on special flags in your views.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;!--SCRIPTS--&gt;
All .js files in assets/linker/js will be included here
In production mode, they will all be concatenated and minified
&lt;!--SCRIPTS END--&gt;

&lt;!--STYLES--&gt;
All .css files in assets/linker/styles (including automatically compile ones from LESS) will be included here
In production mode, they will all be concatenated and minified
&lt;!--STYLES END--&gt;

&lt;!--TEMPLATES--&gt;
All *.html files will be compiled as JST templates and included here.
&lt;!--TEMPLATES END--&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Jade templates are also supported</p>
<pre><code class="lang-jade">// SCRIPTS
// SCRIPTS END

// STYLES
// STYLES END

// TEMPLATES
// TEMPLATES END</code></pre>
<p>If you did not create an application with the <code>--linker</code> option, you will need to create the following file structure
and also add the special flags metioned above into the desired views:</p>
<pre><code>assets/
  linker/
    js/
    styles/
    templates/</code></pre>
<p>Since the order of styles and scripts is important, you can change the order of injection by opening your
<code>Gruntfile.js</code> file. You will see three arrays at the top of the file where you can use Grunt-style
wildcard/glob/splat expressions to order your assets.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">module.exports = function (grunt) {

 &#39;use strict&#39;;

 ...

  var jsFilesToInject = [
    // Need this order for these libraries to work correctly
    &#39;linker/js/vendor/jquery.js&#39;,
    &#39;linker/js/vendor/underscore.js&#39;,
    &#39;linker/js/vendor/backbone.js&#39;,

    // Inject all of js assests after
    &#39;linker/**/*.js&#39;
  ];

 ...

}</code></pre>
