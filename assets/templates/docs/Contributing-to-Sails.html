<h1>Contributing to this project</h1>
<p>Thank you for your interest in supporting Sails!  It makes us feel warm and fuzzy inside.  For real.</p>
<h2>Guidelines</h2>
<p>Like any OSS project, we must have guidelines for contributions.  It helps protect the quality of the code, and gives all of us confidence that our framework will be robust and dependable.
Whether it&#39;s a bug fix, or a huge new feature set, it&#39;s important that we consistently apply these checks and balances for <em>all</em> contributions to Sails.</p>
<p>Please check over the following requirements before submitting a pull request:
 - Pull requests should be submitted to the Development Branch.
 - Bug fixes should have accompanying tests.
 - Should follow Sails.JS JShint Guidelines (See .jshint file in repo)</p>
<p>Any pull request to <code>master</code> (our production branch) will be closed, with an invitation to resubmit to <code>development</code>.<br>I know this stuff sounds kind of brutal, but we want to keep <code>master</code>&#39;s tests passing at all times, since it reflects what is in <code>npm</code>.
If you have a high priority hot-fix for the currently deployed version, please let us know with an issue, and mention @mikermcneil and @dcbartlett.  Also, for emergencies, please feel free to tweet @sailsjs.  That&#39;ll text me (Mike).  Sounds a little insane probably, but if there&#39;s a big problem, I want to know about it!</p>
<p>Now that we are all on the same page, lets get to coding some awesomeness of our own :D</p>
<h2>Fork</h2>

<p>Make your enhancements, fix bugs, do your <code>thang</code>.</p>
<h2>Test</h2>
<p>Please write a test for your addition/fix.  I know it kind of sucks if you&#39;re not used to it, but it&#39;s how we maintain great code.

<h2>Trying out your fork with your application</h2>
<p>If you have a project using Sails, and you want to test your new version, please do the following:</p>
<p>In your Sails repo:
sudo npm link</p>
<p>In your project repo:
npm link sails</p>
<p>Tada!  Your project will now be using your forked version.  If you&#39;re not sure it worked, put some crazy <code>console.log()</code> in the core to make sure.  Again, if you&#39;ve got any issues, hit us up (<a href="https://twitter.com/sailsjs">@sailsjs</a>). </p>
