<h3 id="purpose">Purpose</h3>
<p>This file is where you can define explicit routes to connect clients with the resources that they request.</p>
<p>When a user tries to access a resource on your app, Sails uses this file (and a few other things) in order to map the URL requested to it&#39;s appropriate controller action which upon authentication, will respond to the client with the requested resource.  </p>
<p>By default, there is only one explicitely defined route.  Its purpose is to point users that try to access the base URL <code>http://localhost:1337/</code> to the view located in <code>myApp/views/home/index.ejs</code>. Feel free to add as many routes as you&#39;d like to this file.  </p>
<p>You can even define routes in a way such that part of the requested URL is treated as a request parameter. For example, <code>http://localhost:1337/ponies/PinkiePie</code> would request the resource with the &#39;id&#39; parameter equal to &#39;PinkiePie&#39;.</p>
