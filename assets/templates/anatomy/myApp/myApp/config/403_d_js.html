<p>This file contains customizable Sails middleware used to assist with delivering the &#39;403&#39; status code for an http request.  </p>
<p>If no route matches are found for a request, Sails will respond using this handler.</p>
<p>This middleware can also be invoked manually from a controller or policy with <code>res.forbidden([Error Message])</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This function is Sails middleware. This means that not only do <code>req</code> and <code>res</code> work just like their Express equivalents to handle HTTP requests, they also simulate the same interface for receiving socket messages.</p>
