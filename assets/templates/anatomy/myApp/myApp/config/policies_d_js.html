<h3 id="purpose">Purpose</h3>
<p>This file contains the default policies for your app.</p>
<p>Policies are simply Express middleware functions which run before your controllers. You can apply one or more policies to a given controller, or protect just one of it&#39;s actions. Any policy file (e.g. <code>myApp/api/policies/authenticated.js</code>) can be dropped into the <code>myApp/api/policies/</code> folder, at which point it can be accessed by it&#39;s filename, minus the extension, (e.g. <code>authenticated</code>).</p>
