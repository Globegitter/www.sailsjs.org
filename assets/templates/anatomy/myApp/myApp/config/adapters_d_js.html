<p>This file contains the settings for all of your adapters.</p>
<p>In Sails, adapters act as the middleman (or middlelady) between the app and the database.  To put it another way, they act as plugins for <a href="https://github.com/balderdashy/waterline">Waterline</a>, the fancy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping">ORM</a> that Sails uses to talk to databases.   </p>
<p>This file lets you create different global &quot;saved settings&quot; that you can mix and match in your models. The <code>default</code> option indicates which &quot;saved setting&quot; should be used if a model doesn&#39;t have an adapter specified.  Keep in mind that options you define directly in your model definitions will override these default settings.</p>
