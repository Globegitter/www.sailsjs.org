<p>This file contains information that tells Sails where to store your sessions.  </p>
<p>Sails session integration leans heavily on the great work already done by Express, but also unifies socket.io with the Connect session store. It uses Connect&#39;s cookie parser to normalize configuration differences between Express and socket.io and hooks into Sails&#39; middleware interpreter to allow you to access and auto-save to <code>req.session</code> with Socket.io the same way you would with Express.</p>
<p>This is where you would go to configure a different session store like Redis or Mongo.  In this file you will find commented examples of what that configuration should look like.  </p>
<p>This file also contains your &#39;Session Secret&#39; that is generated by Sails when you create your app.  Do not change or remove this unless you really know what you are doing. </p>
