<p>Every time you view a page on your Sails app, a connection between your browser and Sails is made via Socket.IO.  This file is the reason that connection is made. It should be treated as an example for working with Socket.IO + Sails.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it&#39;s a great file to keep and add additional Socket.IO code in order to keep your Socket.IO code clean and seperate from your other client-side javascript.</p>
