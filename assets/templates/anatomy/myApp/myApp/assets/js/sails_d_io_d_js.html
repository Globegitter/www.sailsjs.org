<h3 id="purpose">Purpose</h3>
<p>This file adds a few custom methods to socket.io which provide the &quot;built-in&quot; websockets functionality for Sails.</p>
<p>Specifically, those methods allow you to send and receive Socket.IO messages to &amp; from Sails by simulating a REST client interface on top of Socket.IO. It models it&#39;s API after the $.ajax pattern from jQuery which you might be familiar with.</p>
