<h3 id="purpose">Purpose</h3>
<p>This file was created when you ran &#39;sails generate User&#39;.  It contains the structure for the model called &#39;User&#39;.</p>
<p>In this file you will specify what attributes each model instance (record) should have.  You can also add custom model instance methods, specify &#39;policies&#39; which can be defined in <code>/myApp/api/policies/</code> , and even specify which storage adapter should be used for storing/retreiving these records.  </p>
<p>One of the best parts about Sails is it uses <a href="https://github.com/balderdashy/waterline">Waterline</a>.  This means you can start developing your data models long before you commit to a particular database. </p>
