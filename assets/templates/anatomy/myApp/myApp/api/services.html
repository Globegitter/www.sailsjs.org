<h3 id="purpose">Purpose</h3>
<p>This folder contains your services.  &#39;Services&#39; are similar to controller actions but are typically used for things that don&#39;t nessecarily have to happen between the time when the user sends a request and when the server sends back a response.  Any logic that doesn&#39;t rely on <code>.req()</code> and <code>.res()</code> can be turned into a service if for no other reason than to keep your controllers clean and managable.  </p>
<p>Hypothetically, one could create a service for</p>
<ul>
<li>Sending emails</li>
<li>Automating tweets to celebrities</li>
<li>Retreiving data from a third party API then pushing that data to your client WHEN IT&#39;S READY (over websockets)</li>
</ul>
<p>Services are written in one or more .js file within this directory. </p>
<h3 id="example-email-js">Example Email.js</h3>
<pre><code>module.exports = {
    send: function(to,from,body){
        // fancy code that sends an email
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>You would call this service with <code>Email.send(&#39;rick&#39;,&#39;bill&#39;,&#39;lol&#39;)</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mind your case.  Email.send !== email.send</p>
