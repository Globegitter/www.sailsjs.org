<h3 id="purpose">Purpose</h3>
<p>This is the directory that holds your models.  In Sails, models are the structures that contain data for your Sails App.</p>
<p>When you call <code>sails generate model cats</code> via the command line from inside your project&#39;s root directory, Sails will generate the file <code>myApp/api/models/Cat.js</code>.  In that file you can put lay out how the records in your database will look and function.</p>
