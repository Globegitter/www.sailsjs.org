<p>This is the directory that holds your controllers.  In Sails, controllers are javascript files that contain logic for interacting with models and rendering appropriate views to the client.</p>
<p>When you call <code>sails generate controller cats</code> via the command line from inside your project&#39;s root directory, Sails will generate the file <code>myApp/api/controllers/CatsController.js</code>. </p>
