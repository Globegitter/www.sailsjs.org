<h3 id="purpose">Purpose</h3>
<p>Sails uses <a href="http://gruntjs.com">Grunt</a> for asset management. This file contains configuration information for the GRUNT tasks that Sails for this purpose. </p>
<p>If you created your Sails app with <code>sails new foo --linker</code>, this is also where you can define the location of files that are automatically minified and injected (in order) into the views rendered by your app.</p>
<p>At the top part of this file, you&#39;ll find a few of the most commonly configured options, but Sails&#39; integration with Grunt is also fully customizable.  If you&#39;d like to work with your assets differently  you can change this file to do anything you like!</p>
