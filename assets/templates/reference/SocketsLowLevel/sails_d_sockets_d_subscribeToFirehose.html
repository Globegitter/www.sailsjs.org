<p>The firehose publish messages using the &quot;firehose&quot; event. By default, messages will be published when a model instance is created, destroyed, or updated, or when an associated collection is added to or removed from.  The message content is similar to that for the <a href="#!documentation/reference/ModelMethods/ModelMethods.html">PubSub methods</a> like PublishUpdate, PublishCreate, etc.</p>
<p>Note that you can also subscribe to the firehose from the client side by making a socket GET request to <code>/firehose</code>.</p>
