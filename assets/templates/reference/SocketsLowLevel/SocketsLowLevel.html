<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Sails exposes several low-level methods for realtime communication with the client via <code>sails.sockets</code>.  These methods are implemented using a <a href="http://socket.io">Socket.io</a> connection which is available as <code>sails.io</code>; however, using the <code>sails.sockets</code> methods instead will future-proof your app against possible changes in underlying implementation.  If your app is mainly sending messages to the client regarding changes in your models, you should try and use the <a href="https://github.com/balderdashy/sails-docs/blob/0.10/reference/ModelMethods.md#publishcreate-datasocket-">model PubSub methods</a> instead.</p>
