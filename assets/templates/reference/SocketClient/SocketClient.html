<p>Not only does Sails have Socket.IO built right into the framework, it also adds a few extra methods that makes using Socket.io with Sails very powerful.  The file &#39;/assets/js/sails.io.js&#39; is where those methods can be found.</p>
<p>They basically allow you to emit custom socket.io messages that when interpreted by Sails, mimic Express HTTP request. This means you can use <code>socket.post(&#39;/user/&#39;)</code> in your client side javascript to effectively create an HTTP Post Request.  Check out the methods and their examples below.</p>
