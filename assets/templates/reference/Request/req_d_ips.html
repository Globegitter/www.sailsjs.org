<p>When &quot;trust proxy&quot; is <code>true</code>, parse the &quot;X-Forwarded-For&quot; ip address list and return an array, otherwise an empty array is returned. For example if the value were &quot;client, proxy1, proxy2&quot; you would receive the array <code>[&quot;client&quot;, &quot;proxy1&quot;, &quot;proxy2&quot;]</code> where &quot;proxy2&quot; is the furthest down-stream.</p>
