<h1 id="res-locals">res.locals</h1>
<h3 id="purpose">Purpose</h3>
<p>Response local variables are scoped to the request, thus only available to the view(s) rendered during that request / response cycle, if any. Otherwise this API is identical to app.locals.</p>
<p>This object is useful for exposing request-level information such as the request pathname, authenticated user, user settings etcetera.</p>
<h3 id="example-usage">Example Usage</h3>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">app.use(function(req, res, next){
  res.locals.user = req.user;
  res.locals.authenticated = ! req.user.anonymous;
  next();
});</code></pre>
