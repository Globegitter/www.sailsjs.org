<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>With Sails and Waterline you can associate models across all data stores. This means that<br>your users can live in PostgreSQL and their photos can live in MongoDB and you can interact with<br>the data as if they lived together on the same database. You can also have associations that<br>live on seperate connections or in different databases within the same adapter.</p>
